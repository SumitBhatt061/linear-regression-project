📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a simple linear regression model can be used for real-world prediction tasks.
We trained the model on a dataset containing employees’ experience (in years) and their salaries, and then used it to predict salaries for unseen data.

Key Steps:

📂 Loaded and explored the dataset.

📊 Visualized the relationship between YearsExperience and Salary.

✂️ Split the data into training and test sets.

🤖 Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

📈 Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.

📊 Results

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~3737

Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~23,370,078.8

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~4835


➡️ Interpretation: On average, the model’s salary prediction is off by around ₹3.7k – ₹4.8k.
