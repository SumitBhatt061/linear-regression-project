# 📊 Simple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates **Simple Linear Regression** using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.  
It was implemented and run on **Google Colab**, and then uploaded here for version control and portfolio building.

## 📌 Project Overview
Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line.  

In this project:
- We trained a regression model on sample data.
- Evaluated the model using the **R² score**.
- Visualized the regression line along with the dataset.

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. Import required libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sklearn`).
2. Load dataset into Colab (CSV or synthetic data)
